            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project integrates web scraping and machine learning 
                to analyze and predict NBA player statistics. The data is 
                gathered by systematically scraping regular season and playoff
                 stats for each player since the 2014-15 season from the NBA 
                 website. The web scraping process incorporates random delays to 
                 mimic human behavior and avoid detection. Using a Random Forest 
                 Regressor, the model is trained to predict player statistics for 
                 key features. Predictions are then applied to individual players, 
                 showcasing expected performance for the upcoming season. Additionally, 
                 the project includes a feature to identify potential MVP candidates based 
                 on weighted scores derived from predicted statistics.</p>
